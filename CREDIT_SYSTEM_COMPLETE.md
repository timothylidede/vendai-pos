# Already configured
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=vendai-fa58c
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
```

### Firestore Setup

1. **Create Collections** (auto-created on first write):
   - `organizations/{orgId}/credit_applications`
   - `organizations/{orgId}/credit_facilities`
   - `organizations/{orgId}/credit_disbursements`
   - `organizations/{orgId}/repayment_schedules`
   - `organizations/{orgId}/credit_scores`

2. **Deploy Indexes**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```
   Use indexes from `FIRESTORE_CREDIT_SCHEMA.md`

3. **Deploy Security Rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```
   Add credit rules from schema doc

### Firebase Storage

1. **Create Bucket Structure**:
   ```
   /organizations/{orgId}/credit-documents/{retailerId}/
   ```

2. **Update Storage Rules**:
   ```javascript
   match /organizations/{orgId}/credit-documents/{retailerId}/{document} {
     allow read: if request.auth.uid == retailerId || hasRole('admin');
     allow write: if request.auth.uid == retailerId;
   }
   ```

### Pezesha Setup

1. **Sign up at**: https://pezesha.co.ke/partners
2. **Get API credentials** (sandbox first)
3. **Configure webhook URL**: `https://yourapp.com/api/webhooks/pezesha`
4. **Test in sandbox** before going live

### User Roles

Add `role` field to Firestore users:
```typescript
// In users/{uid} document
{
  role: 'retailer' | 'admin' | 'credit_manager' | 'finance'
}
```

Admin dashboard checks for `admin` or `credit_manager` role.

## 🧪 TESTING GUIDE

### 1. Test Credit Application Flow

**As Retailer**:
1. Navigate to credit application page
2. Fill out all 5 steps:
   - Business info
   - Owner info
   - Credit request (e.g., KES 100,000)
   - Upload 3 required documents
   - Accept all consents + sign
3. Submit application
4. Check Firestore: `credit_applications` collection should have new doc
5. Check console: Pezesha API call should show in logs

**Expected Behavior**:
- Form validates each step
- Documents upload to Firebase Storage
- Signature captured as base64
- Application submitted to Pezesha sandbox
- Application saved to Firestore with status "pending"

### 2. Test Webhook Simulation

**Simulate Application Approval**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://yourapp.com/api/webhooks/pezesha \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Pezesha-Signature: test_signature" \
  -d '{
    "event": "application.approved",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-12T10:00:00Z",
    "data": {
      "applicationId": "APP-12345",
      "retailerId": "user_uid_here",
      "amount": 100000,
      "status": "approved",
      "interestRate": 12,
      "tenorDays": 30
    },
    "signature": "test_signature"
  }'
```

**Check**:
- Application status → "approved"
- New credit_facility document created
- Facility status → "active"
- availableCredit → 100000

### 3. Test Admin Dashboard

**As Admin**:
1. Log in with admin role
2. Navigate to `/admin/credit`
3. Verify all tabs load:
   - Overview shows portfolio metrics
   - Facilities table shows all credit lines
   - Scores table shows credit scores
   - Watchlist shows flagged retailers
   - Upgrades shows eligible retailers
4. Test search functionality
5. Test refresh button

### 4. Test Document Upload

1. Select a file (PDF or image)
2. Drag-and-drop OR click to browse
3. Watch upload progress bar
4. Verify success message
5. Check Firebase Storage: file should be at `organizations/{orgId}/credit-documents/{retailerId}/...`
6. Test "Remove" button

### 5. Test Credit Score Calculation

```typescript
// In browser console or test file
import { assessCredit } from '@/lib/credit-engine'

const testInput = {
  retailerId: 'test-123',
  trailingVolume90d: 200000,
  trailingGrowthRate: 0.20,
  orders90d: 60,
  averageOrderValue: 3333,
  onTimePaymentRate: 0.95,
  disputeRate: 0.01,
  repaymentLagDays: 1,
  creditUtilization: 0.65,
  currentOutstanding: 50000,
  existingCreditLimit: 100000,
  consecutiveOnTimePayments: 15,
  daysSinceSignup: 365,
  sectorRisk: 'medium',
}

const result = assessCredit(testInput)
console.log('Credit Score:', result.score)
console.log('Tier:', result.tier.label)
console.log('Recommended Limit:', result.recommendedLimit)
console.log('Breakdown:', result.breakdown)

// Expected: Score ~75-80 (Scale tier), Limit ~250K
```
