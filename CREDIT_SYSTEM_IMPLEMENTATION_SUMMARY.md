## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

### Week 1-2: Credit Engine Foundation âœ…

#### 1. Pezesha API Integration (`lib/pezesha-api.ts` - 460 lines)

**Features**:
- Complete REST API client with HMAC authentication
- Sandbox/production environment support
- TypeScript interfaces for all API payloads

**Methods Implemented**:
```typescript
- submitCreditApplication() // Submit retailer credit application
- getApplicationStatus()     // Check application status
- requestDisbursement()      // Request payment to supplier
- getDisbursementStatus()    // Check disbursement status
- recordRepayment()          // Record manual repayment
- getOutstandingBalance()    // Get retailer balance
- verifyWebhookSignature()   // HMAC signature verification
- parseWebhook()             // Parse and validate webhooks
```

**Helper Functions**:
- `calculateAvailableCredit()` - Calculate available credit
- `hasAvailableCredit()` - Check if retailer has sufficient credit
- `calculateCreditUtilization()` - Calculate utilization percentage
- `generateDisbursementReference()` - Generate unique reference numbers
- `isPaymentOverdue()` - Check if payment is overdue
- `calculateDaysOverdue()` - Calculate days overdue

---

#### 2. Enhanced Credit Scoring Algorithm (`lib/credit-engine.ts`)

**6-Component Scoring System** (0-100 points):

| Component | Max Points | Weight | Calculation |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Sales Performance** | 30 | 30% | Based on 90-day trailing volume |
| **Payment History** | 30 | 30% | On-time payment rate (90%+ = full points) |
| **Transaction Consistency** | 15 | 15% | Order frequency and regularity |
| **Business Tenure** | 10 | 10% | Days since signup (365+ = full points) |
| **Growth Trajectory** | 10 | 10% | Sales growth rate (15%+ = full points) |
| **Credit Utilization** | 5 | 5% | Current credit usage (30-70% optimal) |

**Credit Tiers**:
- **Starter** (0-54 points): KES 50,000 - 100,000
- **Growth** (55-69 points): KES 100,000 - 250,000
- **Scale** (70-84 points): KES 250,000 - 350,000
- **Elite** (85-100 points): KES 350,000 - 500,000

- Organization ID must be set
```

### 2. Credit Application (Retailer View)
```bash
# Create a credit application component page
# Import: import { CreditApplicationForm } from '@/components/credit/credit-application-form'

<CreditApplicationForm
  onSuccess={(applicationId) => console.log('Success:', applicationId)}
  onError={(error) => console.error('Error:', error)}
/>
```

### 3. Webhook Testing
```bash
# Use Postman or curl to test webhook endpoint
POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/pezesha
Headers:
  x-pezesha-signature: <calculated_hmac>
Body:
{
  "event": "application.approved",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T10:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "applicationId": "APP-12345",
    "retailerId": "user123",
    "amount": 100000,
    "status": "approved"
  }
}
```

### 4. Firestore Queries
```typescript
// Get all credit applications for organization
const applicationsRef = collection(db, 'organizations', orgId, 'credit_applications')
const q = query(applicationsRef, orderBy('submittedAt', 'desc'))
const snapshot = await getDocs(q)

// Get active credit facilities
const facilitiesRef = collection(db, 'organizations', orgId, 'credit_facilities')
const activeQuery = query(facilitiesRef, where('status', '==', 'active'))
const activeFacilities = await getDocs(activeQuery)
```
