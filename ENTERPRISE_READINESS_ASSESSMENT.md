## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**VendAI has strong potential but needs significant work to attract Naivas/Chandarana.**

**Biggest Gaps:**
1. Multi-store management (DEAL BREAKER)
2. Security & compliance (DEAL BREAKER)
3. Expiry tracking (DEAL BREAKER for food retailers)
4. Enterprise reporting
5. Integrations

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Build MVP enterprise features (3 months)
2. Pilot with 10-20 store chain (3-6 months)
3. Refine and scale (6-9 months)
4. Approach Naivas/Chandarana (after 12 months)

**Don't approach too early!** Rushing to enterprise clients without proper features will damage reputation and lose the opportunity permanently.

**This is a marathon, not a sprint. Build it right, then scale.**
