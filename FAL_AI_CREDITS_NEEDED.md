# ‚ö†Ô∏è FAL.ai Account Needs Credits

## ‚úÖ Good News
Your API key is **working correctly**! The connection is successful.

## üí≥ Action Required
Your FAL.ai account needs credits to generate images.

### Go to FAL.ai Billing Dashboard
üëâ **https://fal.ai/dashboard/billing**

### Add Credits
1. Click "Add Credits"
2. Recommended amounts:
   - **$5** - For testing (covers ~1,600 images)
   - **$10** - For 10-50 test images + buffer
   - **$25** - For full library generation ($21) + buffer

### Why Credits Are Needed
- FAL.ai uses a pay-as-you-go model
- Free tier credits have been exhausted
- You only pay for what you use: **$0.003 per image**

## üìä Cost Breakdown

| Task | Images | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| Connection test (1 image) | 1 | $0.003 |
| Initial test (10 images) | 10 | $0.03 |
| Small test (50 images) | 50 | $0.15 |
| **Full distributor library** | **7,000** | **$21.00** |

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Add $10 for Testing (Recommended)
Perfect for testing with 10-50 images, then decide on full generation.

```powershell
# After adding credits, test with 10 images:
npx tsx scripts/test-fal-connection.ts
npx tsx scripts/generate-images-fal.ts --limit 10 --dry-run
npx tsx scripts/generate-images-fal.ts --limit 10
```

### Option 2: Add $25 for Full Generation
Go straight to generating the complete library.

```powershell
# After adding credits, generate everything:
npx tsx scripts/generate-images-fal.ts
```

## Alternative: Use Existing Replicate Account

If you prefer to use your existing Replicate setup (already configured):

**Cost:** $210 for 7,000 images (10x more expensive)
**Current setup:** Already working with `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` in .env.local

```powershell
# Use existing Replicate implementation
npx tsx scripts/generate-distributor-images.ts --limit 10
```

---

## üí° Recommendation

**Add $10 to FAL.ai and test with 10 images first**

Why?
- ‚úÖ 90% cheaper than Replicate ($0.03 vs $0.30 for 10 images)
- ‚úÖ Same or better quality (FLUX schnell model)
- ‚úÖ Faster generation (2-3 seconds per image)
- ‚úÖ Low risk ($10 investment to validate approach)
- ‚úÖ Can scale to full library later ($21 total)
