# FINAL IMPROVEMENTS - Intelligent Product Extraction

## Date: October 11, 2025

## üéØ Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Cleaned Up Duplicate Scripts

**Deleted:**
- `scripts/generate-distributor-images.ts` (old Replicate version)
- `generate-distributor-images.ps1` (old launcher)
- `generate-distributor-images.bat` (old launcher)

**Kept:**
- `scripts/generate-distributor-images-fal.ts` (FAL.ai version - the only one needed)

### 2. ‚úÖ Dramatically Improved Extraction Intelligence

#### Previous Issues (Examples from Mahitaji):
```typescript
‚ùå "KIDS S/BRY 200MLX24"           // Abbreviations not expanded
‚ùå "KIDS BLK CURRNT 200MLX24"      // Abbreviations not expanded  
‚ùå "TETRA APPLE 250MLX24***"       // Asterisks in name
‚ùå Brand: "KIDS"                   // Could be better
‚ùå Brand: "RTD"                    // Unclear what RTD is
```

#### New Intelligent Extraction:
```typescript
‚úÖ "Kids Strawberry Juice 200ml"
‚úÖ "Kids Black Currant Juice 200ml"
‚úÖ "Tetra Apple Juice 250ml"
‚úÖ Brand: "Kids"
‚úÖ Description: "Kids brand strawberry flavored juice drink in 200ml individual packs, sold as 24-pack carton. Perfect for children's lunchboxes and parties."
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Enhanced Prompt Instructions

**New Prompt Features:**
- **Spell Out Everything**: AI now expands all abbreviations
  - "S/BRY" ‚Üí "Strawberry"
  - "BLK CURRNT" ‚Üí "Black Currant"
  - "RASPBRY" ‚Üí "Raspberry"
  - "STRWBRY" ‚Üí "Strawberry"

- **Remove Special Characters**: 
  - No apostrophes in names
  - No asterisks (***) 
  - No slashes (/)
  - Clean, professional formatting

- **Intelligent Brand Extraction**:
  - Recognizes actual brand names vs sizes
  - "10KG ABABIL" ‚Üí Brand: "Ababil" (not "10KG")
  - "KIDS APPLE 200MLX24" ‚Üí Brand: "Kids"
  - "RTD 1.5LTRX6" ‚Üí Brand: "RTD"

- **Professional Name Format**:
  ```
  Format: [Brand] [Product Type] [Flavor/Variety] [Size]
  
  Examples:
  - "Kids Apple Juice 200ml"
  - "Ababil Basmati Rice 10kg"
  - "Coca Cola Original 500ml"
  ```

- **Better Descriptions**:
  - Full packaging details
  - Flavor descriptions
  - Use cases
  - Pack sizes (e.g., "24-pack carton")

### 4. ‚úÖ Improved Post-Processing

**New Cleaning Functions:**
```typescript
// Remove apostrophes and special characters
cleanName = p.name
  .replace(/'/g, '')  // Remove apostrophes
  .replace(/\*/g, '')  // Remove asterisks
  .replace(/\s+/g, ' ') // Normalize spaces
  .trim();

// Better validation
const commonAbbreviations = /^(s\/bry|blk|currnt|raspbry|strwbry)$/i;
if (commonAbbreviations.test(brand)) return false;
```

### 5. ‚úÖ Increased AI Intelligence

**Changed Temperature:**
```typescript
// Before: 0.1 (very deterministic, literal)
temperature: 0.1

// After: 0.3 (more intelligent, creative reformatting)
temperature: 0.3
```

**Updated System Message:**
```typescript
'You are an intelligent product catalog specialist. Your job is to 
understand raw product data and intelligently format it into clean, 
professional product listings. Expand abbreviations, spell out 
shortcuts, and create uniform, professional product names.'
```
