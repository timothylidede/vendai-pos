## 🌐 Step 3: Update vendai-website with Correct API URL

### Update Your Download Page Code
Replace the API URL in your vendai-website project:

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong (this was causing the 404)
const API_URL = 'https://vendai-pos.vercel.app/api/releases/latest';

// ✅ Correct (use your actual deployment URL)
const API_URL = 'https://YOUR-ACTUAL-URL.vercel.app/api/releases/latest';

// Example:
const API_URL = 'https://vendai-pos-abc123def.vercel.app/api/releases/latest';
```

### Test the Integration
1. Update your vendai-website code
2. Deploy vendai-website 
3. Visit the download page
4. Verify it loads release information correctly

**PROMPT FOR VENDAI.DIGITAL COPILOT:**

```
I need to create a download page for VendAI POS desktop app. I have a working API that serves release information from the POS app repository.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a modern download page at /download or /vendai-pos-download
2. Fetch release info from: https://vendai-pos.vercel.app/api/releases/latest (or your domain)
3. Auto-detect user's operating system
4. Show appropriate download buttons for Windows, Mac, Linux
5. Include system requirements and installation instructions

API Response Format:
```json
{
  "version": "v1.0.0",
  "name": "VendAI POS v1.0.0",
  "publishedAt": "2025-09-18T...",
  "downloads": {
    "total": 1234,
    "windows": [
      {
        "name": "VendAI-POS-v1.0.0-Windows-Setup.exe",
        "url": "https://github.com/timothylidede/vendai-pos/releases/download/v1.0.0/...",
        "size": 12345678,
        "platform": "windows",
        "type": "installer",
        "downloads": 567
      }
    ],
    "macos": [...],
    "linux": [...]
  }
}
```

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Use your existing design system/components
- Make it responsive
- Show file sizes in human-readable format
- Include download statistics if available
- Add loading states while fetching
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Add a "Coming soon" state if no releases exist yet

COPY THE WORKING HTML TEMPLATE:
I have a working template at website-integration.html - use this as reference for the JavaScript logic and styling approach. Adapt it to your framework (Next.js/React/etc).

Create a professional download experience that matches vendai.digital's branding.
```

---

### Alternative: Direct HTML Integration
If you prefer to use the standalone HTML file:

1. **Copy `website-integration.html` to your website**
2. **Update the API URL** (line ~88):
   ```javascript
   // Change this line:
   const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/timothylidede/vendai-pos/releases/latest');
   
   // To this (using your deployed API):
   const response = await fetch('https://vendai-pos.vercel.app/api/releases/latest');
   ```
3. **Customize branding** to match vendai.digital
4. **Add to your website** as `/download.html` or integrate into existing page

---

## 🔧 Step 3: Test the Complete Flow

### 3.1 Test Release API
```bash
# Test the latest release endpoint
curl https://vendai-pos.vercel.app/api/releases/latest

# Should return JSON with version, downloads, etc.
```

### 3.2 Test Download Page
1. Visit your download page on vendai.digital
2. Verify platform detection works
3. Test download links (after GitHub Actions completes)
4. Check responsive design on mobile

### 3.3 Test Auto-Updates (After First Release)
1. Build and run the desktop app locally
2. Publish a v1.0.1 release
3. App should detect and offer the update

---

## 📊 Step 4: Monitor & Analytics

### GitHub Release Analytics
- View download stats: GitHub repo → Releases → View download counts
- Monitor build status: GitHub repo → Actions tab

### Optional: Enhanced Analytics
Add tracking to download page:
```javascript
// Track download clicks
function trackDownload(platform, filename) {
  // Add your analytics code here
  gtag('event', 'download', {
    'event_category': 'VendAI POS',
    'event_label': platform,
    'value': 1
  });
}
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check GitHub Actions logs

- Verify all dependencies are installed

### Download Links Don't Work
