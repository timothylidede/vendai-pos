## üéØ Why This Credit System Works

### For Retailers
1. **No Collateral**: Credit based on sales performance, not assets
2. **Fast Approval**: Algorithm + Pezesha KYC = 24-48 hour decisions
3. **Growing Limits**: Credit increases automatically with good behavior
4. **Fair Pricing**: 10-15% interest vs 18-25% at banks
5. **Builds Credit History**: CRB reporting improves national credit score

### For VendAI
1. **Revenue Stream**: Commission on every disbursement (2-5%)
2. **Sticky Customers**: Credit keeps retailers on platform
3. **Data Goldmine**: Credit behavior = business health insights
4. **Competitive Edge**: No other POS in Kenya offers embedded credit
5. **Scalable**: Pezesha handles compliance, we focus on UX

### For Pezesha
1. **Distribution**: Access to 1000+ verified retailers
2. **Data Quality**: Real POS data = accurate risk assessment
3. **Low CAC**: VendAI handles retailer acquisition
4. **Tech Integration**: Modern API-first partner
5. **Growth Market**: SME lending in Kenya = huge opportunity

## üí∞ Credit System Revenue Model

### Commission Structure (Estimated)

**Scenario A: Fixed Commission**
- 3% per disbursement
- Example: KES 100,000 loan = KES 3,000 to VendAI
- Annual potential (1000 retailers, 4 loans/year avg): **KES 12M**

**Scenario B: Shared Risk**
- 5% commission + 20% of defaults absorbed
- Higher reward, higher risk
- Annual potential: **KES 20M** (if default rate <3%)

### Break-Even Analysis

**Assumptions**:
- 100 active credit users (first year)
- Average loan: KES 150,000
- 6 disbursements per retailer per year
- 3% commission rate

**Revenue**:
```
100 retailers √ó 6 loans √ó KES 150,000 √ó 3% = KES 2.7M annually
```

**Costs**:
- Pezesha integration: KES 200K (one-time)
- CRB checks: KES 50 per retailer √ó 100 = KES 5K
- Support/operations: KES 300K annually

**Net Profit**: KES 2.4M Year 1 ‚Üí Scales to KES 12-20M by Year 2-3

## üö® Known Gaps & Risks

### Technical Gaps
1. **Invoice Payment Tracking**: Need to capture supplier payment dates
2. **CRB Integration**: Pezesha handles this, but need consent UI
3. **M-Pesa STK Push**: Need to test auto-debit flow thoroughly
4. **Webhook Security**: HMAC signature verification for Pezesha webhooks

### Business Risks
1. **Default Rate**: If >5%, profitability suffers
   - **Mitigation**: Start with conservative limits (KES 50K), grow slowly
2. **Fraud**: Fake business registrations, duplicate KRA PINs
   - **Mitigation**: Manual review for first 100 applications
3. **Liquidity**: Pezesha may have disbursement limits
   - **Mitigation**: Confirm maximum monthly disbursement volume
4. **Regulatory**: CBK regulations on embedded lending
   - **Mitigation**: Pezesha handles compliance, ensure partnership agreement
