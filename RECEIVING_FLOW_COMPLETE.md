**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Testing  
**Phase**: 1.1 Core Workflow Completion

---

## What You Asked For

‚úÖ **Implement `/api/supplier/receiving` endpoint**  
‚úÖ **Build receiving UI in supplier module**

## What I Built

### üóÇÔ∏è Files Created

1. **`types/purchase-orders.ts`**
   - Complete TypeScript types for POs, lines, requests, responses
   - Status flow definitions

2. **`lib/purchase-order-operations.ts`**
   - `createPurchaseOrder()` ‚Äî Create PO from cart
   - `getPurchaseOrder()` ‚Äî Fetch by ID
   - `listPurchaseOrders()` ‚Äî Query for org
   - `receiveDelivery()` ‚Äî **Atomic transaction** that updates PO, inventory, and creates COGS ledger

3. **`app/api/supplier/purchase-orders/route.ts`**
   - POST endpoint to create POs
   - Validates auth, line items, prices
   - Returns PO ID

4. **`app/api/supplier/receiving/route.ts`**
   - POST endpoint to receive deliveries
   - Calls atomic transaction
   - Updates inventory (qtyBase/qtyLoose)
   - Creates COGS ledger entry

5. **`components/modules/receiving-modal.tsx`**
   - Full-featured receiving UI
   - Scan/enter PO number
   - Line-by-line quantity controls
   - Prevents over-receiving
   - Shows summary and value

6. **`docs/RECEIVING_FLOW_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**
   - Complete implementation guide
   - API documentation
   - Testing checklist
   - Deploy steps

7. **`test-receiving-flow.ps1`**
   - Quick test script
   - Checks all files present
   - TypeScript validation
   - Manual test steps

### üìù Files Updated

1. **`components/modules/supplier-module.tsx`**
   - Added "Receive Delivery" button in header (blue, with Package icon)
   - Wired cart checkout to create actual POs via API
   - Groups cart by distributor (creates one PO per supplier)
   - Shows loading states and success toasts
   - Added ReceivingModal integration

2. **`firestore.indexes.json`**
   - Added indexes for `purchase_orders` collection:
     - `orgId + createdAt DESC`

3. **`docs/TODO.md`**
   - Marked receiving flow tasks as complete ‚úÖ

## How It Works

### Create Purchase Order (Retailer Flow)
```
1. Browse supplier catalog
2. Add products to cart
3. Click cart icon
4. Click "Place Order"
   ‚Üì
5. Frontend groups cart by distributor
6. Calls POST /api/supplier/purchase-orders for each supplier
7. Backend creates PO documents in Firestore
8. Returns PO IDs
9. Success toast shows: "2 purchase orders created totaling KES 45,000"
```

### Receive Delivery (Warehouse Flow)
```
1. Goods arrive from supplier
2. Click "Receive" button in header
3. Enter/scan PO number
   ‚Üì
4. System fetches PO with lines
5. For each line item:
   - Shows: ordered, already received, remaining
   - Enter quantity received (with +/- buttons)
6. Review summary (total items, value)
7. Click "Confirm Receipt"
   ‚Üì
8. Backend runs Firestore transaction:
   - Updates PO lines with received quantities
   - Converts pieces to qtyBase/qtyLoose
   - Increments inventory atomically
   - Updates PO status (partially_received or received)
   - Creates COGS ledger entry
9. Success toast: "Delivery received and inventory updated"
```

## Key Features

### üîí Transaction Safety
- **Atomic operations**: Inventory + PO + Ledger all update together or not at all
- **No partial updates** on failure
- **Firestore transactions** prevent race conditions

### üéØ Smart Inventory Math
- Converts piece quantities to qtyBase/qtyLoose using `unitsPerBase`
- Example: Receive 50 pieces with unitsPerBase=24
  - qtyBase = 2 (cartons)
  - qtyLoose = 2 (pieces)

### ‚úÖ Validation & Safety
- Prevents over-receiving (can't receive more than remaining)
- Validates org ownership
- Checks PO status (can't receive cancelled or already-received POs)
- Auth required (Firebase currentUser)

### üìä Partial Receipts
- Supports multiple receiving sessions per PO
- Tracks `quantityReceived` per line
- Status updates: `submitted` ‚Üí `partially_received` ‚Üí `received`

### üí∞ COGS Tracking
- Creates ledger entry with actual cost on receipt
- Links to PO and supplier
- Includes productIds for reconciliation

## Collections Created

### `purchase_orders`
```typescript
{
  id: "po_abc123",
  orgId: "org_xyz",
  supplierId: "sam-west",
  supplierName: "Sam West Supermarket",
  lines: [
    {
      productId: "sw-1",
      productName: "10KG ABABIL Rice",
      quantityOrdered: 100,
      quantityReceived: 98,
      unitPrice: 1295,
      unit: "PCS",
      lineTotal: 129500
    }
  ],
  status: "received",
  totalAmount: 129500,
  expectedDate: "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
  receivedAt: "2025-10-14T15:30:00Z",
  createdAt: "2025-10-11T08:00:00Z",
  createdBy: "user_123"
}
```

### `ledger_entries` (COGS)
```typescript
{
  id: "ledger_xyz",
  orgId: "org_xyz",
  type: "COGS",
  poId: "po_abc123",
  supplierId: "sam-west",
  amount: 126910,  // 98 * 1295
  productIds: ["sw-1"],
  createdAt: "2025-10-14T15:30:00Z",
  description: "COGS for PO po_abc123 - Sam West Supermarket"
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Indexes (Required)
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### 2. Test End-to-End
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Run test checker
.\test-receiving-flow.ps1
```

**Manual test flow**:
1. Navigate to Supplier Module
2. Add 2-3 products to cart
3. Click "Place Order"
4. Note PO ID from toast
5. Click "Receive" button
6. Enter PO number
7. Adjust quantities
8. Confirm receipt
9. Check Inventory Module for updated stock

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Firestore not initialized"
- Ensure Firebase config is correct
- Check `.env.local` has all Firebase keys

### "Purchase order not found"
- Verify PO was created successfully
- Check Firestore console for `purchase_orders` collection
- Ensure orgId matches

### "Cannot receive - status is received"
- PO already fully received
- Check Firestore to see current status

### Inventory not updating
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `inventory` collection exists
- Ensure `pos_products` has matching productIds
