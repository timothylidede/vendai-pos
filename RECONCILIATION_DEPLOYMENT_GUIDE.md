# Three-Way Match Reconciliation - Deployment Guide

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for Deployment

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [x] All TypeScript files compile without errors
- [x] API routes implemented and tested
- [x] UI components integrated into Supplier module
- [x] Firestore indexes defined in firestore.indexes.json
- [x] Documentation complete

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Indexes

The reconciliation system requires 3 composite indexes for efficient querying.

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd c:\Users\lided\Downloads\vendai-pos

# Deploy Firestore indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✔ Deploy complete!

Indexes deployed:
- delivery_reconciliations (orgId, status, createdAt)
- delivery_reconciliations (orgId, matchStatus, createdAt)
- delivery_reconciliations (orgId, supplierId, createdAt)
```

**Index Creation Time**: 5-10 minutes (Firebase builds indexes in background)

### Step 2: Verify Firebase Storage Rules

Ensure Firebase Storage allows authenticated users to upload invoice files:

**File**: `storage.rules`

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /invoices/{orgId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.orgId == orgId;
    }
  }
}
```

Deploy if not already present:
```bash
firebase deploy --only storage
```

### Step 3: Build and Deploy Application

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build application
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel (or your hosting platform)
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

#### Test 1: Check Reconciliation Tab
1. Open application
2. Navigate to Supplier module
3. Verify "Reconciliation" tab appears (teal theme)
4. Click tab - should show empty state or reconciliations

#### Test 2: API Endpoint Health Check
```bash
# List reconciliations (should return empty array initially)
curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/supplier/reconciliations?orgId=test_org" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Expected: { "reconciliations": [], "summary": {...} }
```

#### Test 3: Create Test Reconciliation
1. Create a purchase order
2. Receive delivery with invoice attachment:
   ```
   POST /api/supplier/receiving
   Content-Type: multipart/form-data
   
   Form Data:
   - poId: {po_id}
   - orgId: {org_id}
   - supplierId: {supplier_id}
   - receivedLines: [{...}]
   - invoice_1: {file}
   - invoiceLines: [{...}]
   - invoiceTotal: 1000
   ```
3. Check response includes `reconciliation` object
4. Verify reconciliation appears in dashboard

### Step 5: Monitor Firestore Indexes

Check Firebase Console to ensure indexes are built:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Indexes
2. Verify 3 new indexes for `delivery_reconciliations`
3. Status should be "Enabled" (not "Building")

**If indexes show "Building"**: Wait 5-10 minutes and refresh

### Step 6: Update Firestore Security Rules (Optional)

Add rules for `delivery_reconciliations` collection:

**File**: `firestore.rules`

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Delivery Reconciliations
    match /delivery_reconciliations/{reconciliationId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null 
                  && request.auth.token.orgId == resource.data.orgId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.auth.token.orgId == request.resource.data.orgId;
      allow update: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.auth.token.orgId == resource.data.orgId;
    }
  }
}
```

Deploy rules:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Tests

#### Test Case 1: Perfect Match
- PO: 100 units @ ₹10
- Delivery: 100 units
- Invoice: 100 units @ ₹10
- **Expected**: Auto-approved, matchStatus = 'perfect_match'

#### Test Case 2: Minor Variance
- PO: 100 units @ ₹10
- Delivery: 98 units
- Invoice: 98 units @ ₹10
- **Expected**: Auto-approved (2% variance), matchStatus = 'minor_variance'

#### Test Case 3: Significant Variance (Review Required)
- PO: 100 units @ ₹10
- Delivery: 95 units
- Invoice: 95 units @ ₹11
- **Expected**: Pending review, matchStatus = 'significant_variance'
- **Flags**: PRICE_INCREASE (10%), QUANTITY_SHORTAGE (5 units)

#### Test Case 4: Major Discrepancy
- PO: 100 units @ ₹10
- Delivery: 100 units
- Invoice: 100 units @ ₹15
- **Expected**: Pending review, matchStatus = 'major_discrepancy'
- **Flags**: PRICE_INCREASE (50% - CRITICAL severity)

### Dashboard Tests

1. **Summary Cards**: Verify counts update correctly
2. **Filtering**: Test status and match status filters
3. **Actions**: 
   - Approve reconciliation → Status changes to 'approved'
   - Dispute with notes → Status changes to 'disputed'
4. **Invoice Attachments**: Click attachment links → Files download correctly

### Performance Tests

- [ ] Create 100 reconciliations → Dashboard loads < 2 seconds
- [ ] Concurrent receiving (10 simultaneous) → All reconciliations created
- [ ] File upload (5MB PDF) → Uploads successfully < 10 seconds

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback steps:

### 1. Disable Reconciliation Tab
Comment out tab in `components/modules/supplier-module.tsx`:
```typescript
// Temporarily disable reconciliation tab
// {activeTab === 'reconciliation' && ...}
```

### 2. Revert API Changes
Restore previous version of `/api/supplier/receiving/route.ts`:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 app/api/supplier/receiving/route.ts
git push origin master
```

### 3. Remove Firestore Indexes (if needed)
```bash
# Edit firestore.indexes.json - remove delivery_reconciliations indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Reconciliation Creation Rate**: Reconciliations per day
2. **Auto-Approval Rate**: % of reconciliations auto-approved
3. **Average Discrepancy**: Mean discrepancy amount/percentage
4. **Review Time**: Time from creation to approval/dispute
5. **Error Rate**: Failed reconciliations / total attempts

### Logging

Monitor these logs in production:
- `Error in /api/supplier/receiving:` - Receiving failures
- `Error creating reconciliation:` - Reconciliation engine errors
- `Error uploading file` - File upload failures

### Alerts (Setup Recommended)

- Alert when > 50% reconciliations require review (possible system issue)
- Alert when reconciliation creation fails > 10 times/hour
- Alert when file uploads fail > 20% of attempts

## Training Materials

### For Operations Team

**Quick Start Guide**:
1. New deliveries automatically create reconciliations
2. Check "Reconciliation" tab daily for pending reviews
3. Review discrepancies:
   - Green = Perfect match (already approved)
   - Yellow = Minor variance (auto-approved, informational)
   - Orange = Significant (review recommended)
   - Red = Major discrepancy (action required)
4. Actions:
   - **Approve**: Everything looks correct
   - **Dispute**: Something is wrong, need investigation
5. Add notes explaining decision

### For Developers

**Debug Common Issues**:
- Reconciliation not created → Check invoice data format in request
- Dashboard empty → Verify orgId matches user's organization
- File upload fails → Check Firebase Storage rules and quota
- Indexes not working → Verify indexes status in Firebase Console
