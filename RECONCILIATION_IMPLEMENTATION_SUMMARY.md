# Three-Way Match Reconciliation - Quick Reference

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: October 11, 2025

## What Was Built

Complete three-way match reconciliation system for PO ↔ Delivery ↔ Invoice validation with automatic discrepancy detection and operations dashboard.

## Files Created (8 files)

1. **`types/reconciliation.ts`** (153 lines)
   - 7 TypeScript interfaces for reconciliation system

2. **`lib/reconciliation-engine.ts`** (450 lines)
   - Core reconciliation logic
   - Auto-approval rules
   - Discrepancy flag generation

3. **`lib/invoice-upload.ts`** (120 lines)
   - Firebase Storage file upload
   - Invoice attachment processing

4. **`app/api/supplier/reconciliations/route.ts`** (98 lines)
   - GET endpoint for listing reconciliations

5. **`app/api/supplier/reconciliations/[id]/route.ts`** (87 lines)
   - PATCH endpoint for approve/dispute/resolve actions

6. **`components/modules/reconciliation-dashboard.tsx`** (586 lines)
   - Full-featured operations dashboard UI

## Files Modified (2 files)

7. **`app/api/supplier/receiving/route.ts`** 
   - Extended to accept invoice attachments (multipart/form-data)
   - Creates reconciliation automatically

8. **`components/modules/supplier-module.tsx`**
   - Added "Reconciliation" tab (teal theme)
   - Imported ReconciliationDashboard component

## Key Features

### Automatic Discrepancy Detection
- ✅ Quantity mismatches (shortage/overage)
- ✅ Price changes (increase/decrease)
- ✅ Amount discrepancies
- ✅ Extra items not in PO
- ✅ Missing items

### Auto-Approval Logic
- Discrepancy < ₹100 OR < 2% → Auto-approved
- 2-5% variance → Review required
- 5-10% variance → Significant (manager review)
- >10% → Major discrepancy (high priority)

### Operations Dashboard
- Summary cards (totals, pending, discrepancies)
- Status filtering (pending/approved/disputed/resolved)
- Match status filtering (perfect/minor/significant/major)
- Line-item comparison view
- Invoice attachment viewing
- Approve/Dispute/Resolve workflow

## API Endpoints

### Extended Receiving
```
POST /api/supplier/receiving
Content-Type: multipart/form-data OR application/json
```

### List Reconciliations
```
GET /api/supplier/reconciliations?orgId={id}&status={status}&matchStatus={matchStatus}
```

### Update Reconciliation
```
PATCH /api/supplier/reconciliations/{id}
Body: { action: 'approve' | 'dispute' | 'resolve', notes, ... }
```

## Firestore Collections

### `delivery_reconciliations`
Main collection storing reconciliation records with:
- PO, delivery, and invoice data
- Line-item comparisons
- Discrepancy flags
- Status tracking
- User actions and notes

### Required Indexes (3 composite indexes)
1. `orgId + status + createdAt`
2. `orgId + matchStatus + createdAt`
3. `orgId + supplierId + createdAt`

## Zero TypeScript Errors ✅

All files compile cleanly with TypeScript strict mode.

## Integration

Reconciliation tab added to Supplier Module:
- **Location**: Fourth tab after Supplier, Replenishment, Price Alerts
- **Theme**: Teal gradient (consistent with VendAI design)
- **Icon**: CheckCircle2
- **Component**: `<ReconciliationDashboard orgId={orgId} />`

## Deployment Steps

1. Deploy Firestore indexes:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

2. Verify Firebase Storage rules allow authenticated writes

3. Test receiving flow with invoice attachments

4. Verify reconciliation creation and dashboard display

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Types compile without errors
- [x] API routes return correct responses
- [x] Dashboard loads and filters work
- [x] Actions (approve/dispute) update Firestore
- [ ] End-to-end: Receive → Review → Approve
- [ ] Load test: Multiple reconciliations

## Documentation

Full documentation available in:
- **`RECONCILIATION_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md`** - Complete technical documentation
- **`docs/TODO.md`** - Updated with completion status

## Next Steps

1. Deploy Firestore indexes
2. Test end-to-end workflow
3. Train operations team on dashboard usage
4. Monitor reconciliation metrics
