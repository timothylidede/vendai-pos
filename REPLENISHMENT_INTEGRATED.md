# Auto-Replenishment Integration Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Index Deployment ✅
- **Ran Admin SDK script** to validate all 4 Firestore indexes
- **Confirmed configurations** for:
  - `replenishment_suggestions` (orgId + status + priority + createdAt)
  - `replenishment_suggestions` (orgId + productId + createdAt)
  - `supplier_skus` (productId + availability + leadTimeDays)
  - `supplier_skus` (supplierId + productId)
- **Status**: Indexes validated and ready (already in firestore.indexes.json)

### 2. Dashboard Integration ✅
**Replaced the "Credit" tab with "Auto-Replenishment" tab in Supplier Module**

**Location**: `components/modules/supplier-module.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Changed tab state from `'supplier' | 'credit'` to `'supplier' | 'replenishment'`
- ✅ Replaced "Credit" tab button with "Auto-Replenishment" tab button
- ✅ Imported `ReplenishmentDashboard` component
- ✅ Replaced credit tab content with full replenishment dashboard
- ✅ Added organization check (shows message if no org setup)

**Result**: Auto-replenishment is now accessible directly in the Supplier module!

### Data Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Generate Suggestions"
   → POST /api/replenishment/generate
   
2. Engine scans all products

   → Calculates quantity (reorderQty or 1.5x reorderPoint)
   → Assigns priority (critical/high/medium/low)
   
3. Dashboard displays suggestions
   → GET /api/replenishment/suggestions
   → Filters by status/priority
   → Shows summary statistics
   
4. User approves suggestions
   → PATCH /api/replenishment/suggestions/:id
   → Changes status to "approved"
   
5. User creates PO from batch
   → POST /api/replenishment/create-po
   → Creates purchase order
   → Links suggestions to PO
   → Marks as "ordered"
```
