# 🔒 Secret Leak Incident - Resolved

## What Happened

GitHub's push protection detected API keys in commits `4762e3f` and `818b7a7` and blocked the push. The following secrets were found:
- OpenAI API Key
- Replicate API Token
- Other API credentials in `scripts/setup-all-vercel-env.ps1`

## What We Did to Fix It

### 1. Created a Backup
```bash
git branch backup-before-secret-removal
```

### 2. Removed the Commits with Secrets
```bash
git reset --soft 5b5f052  # Reset to the commit before secrets were added
```

### 3. Updated `.gitignore`
Added these patterns to prevent future leaks:
```
# Scripts with secrets - DO NOT COMMIT
scripts/setup-all-vercel-env.ps1
scripts/setup-vercel-env.ps1
scripts/*-secrets.ps1
scripts/*-api-keys.*
```

### 4. Created Safe Template
Created `scripts/setup-vercel-env.ps1.template` with placeholder values instead of real secrets.

### 5. Committed Clean Version
Committed only the safe files without any hardcoded secrets.

### 6. Force Pushed to GitHub
```bash
git push origin master --force
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Rotate Your API Keys

Since the API keys were exposed (even though not pushed to GitHub), you should rotate them:

### 1. OpenAI API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Revoke the key: `sk-proj-L-8Z3OCoznYuriuUhSwkg0jev...`
3. Create a new API key
4. Update `.env.local`
5. Update Vercel environment variables

### 2. Replicate API Token
1. Go to https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens
2. Revoke the exposed token (starts with `r8_...`)
3. Create a new token
4. Update `.env.local`
5. Update Vercel environment variables

### 3. Other API Keys
Check and rotate if necessary:
- DeepSeek API Key
- Getimg API Key
- M-Pesa credentials (if exposed)

## 🛡️ Best Practices to Prevent Future Leaks

### 1. Never Hardcode Secrets in Scripts
❌ **BAD:**
```powershell
$apiKey = "sk-proj-abc123..."
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```powershell
# Read from environment or prompt user
$apiKey = $env:OPENAI_API_KEY
if (-not $apiKey) {
    $apiKey = Read-Host "Enter OpenAI API Key" -AsSecureString
}
```

### 2. Use Template Files
- Create `.template` versions with placeholders
- Add the real files to `.gitignore`
- Document where to get the values

### 3. Pre-Commit Checks
Consider installing a git pre-commit hook to scan for secrets:

```bash
# Install git-secrets
npm install -g git-secrets

# Set up for your repo
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
```

### 4. Environment Variable Management
- Keep all secrets in `.env.local` (already in `.gitignore`)
- Use Vercel dashboard to manage production secrets
- Never commit `.env.local` or similar files

### 5. Review Before Committing
Always check what you're committing:
```bash
git diff --cached  # Review staged changes before committing
```

## 📝 What Files Are Now Safe

These files are now committed and safe (no secrets):
- ✅ `AUTH-FIX-ACTIONS.md` - Action items for fixing auth issues
- ✅ `AUTH-FIX-QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide
- ✅ `GOOGLE-OAUTH-SETUP.md` - OAuth setup instructions
- ✅ `app/auth-debug/page.tsx` - Debug page (no secrets)
- ✅ `scripts/check-env-vars.js` - Env checker script
- ✅ `scripts/check-env-vars.ps1` - PowerShell env checker
- ✅ `scripts/setup-vercel-env.ps1.template` - Template (placeholders only)
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Updated with secret file patterns

These files are now in `.gitignore` and won't be committed:
- 🚫 `scripts/setup-vercel-env.ps1` (if it exists locally)
- 🚫 `scripts/setup-all-vercel-env.ps1` (if it exists locally)
- 🚫 `.env.local` (already was in .gitignore)

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Rotate API keys** (see above) ⚠️ PRIORITY
2. Continue with the authentication fixes from `AUTH-FIX-ACTIONS.md`
3. Deploy the changes to Vercel
4. Test authentication at https://app.vendai.digital/auth-debug

## 📞 If You Need the Backup

The original commits are preserved in the branch `backup-before-secret-removal`:
```bash
git checkout backup-before-secret-removal  # View original commits
git checkout master  # Return to clean version
```

**Note:** Don't push this backup branch to GitHub - it contains the secrets!

## ✅ Status: RESOLVED

- ✅ Secrets removed from commit history
- ✅ Push to GitHub successful
- ✅ `.gitignore` updated to prevent future leaks
- ✅ Template files created for safe usage
- ⚠️ API keys need rotation (your action required)
