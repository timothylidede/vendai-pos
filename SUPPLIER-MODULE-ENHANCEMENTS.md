- Updated border from `border` to `border-2` for more definition
- Images properly fitted using `object-contain` within circular frames

### 2. **Distributor Data Structure**
Created organized folder: `data/distributors/`

#### Files Created:

### 3. **Product Data from Pricelists**

  - Stock status badge
  - Lead time

#### Styling:

- **Controls**: Previous/Next buttons with chevron icons
- **Status Display**: "Showing X-Y of Z products"
- **Page Counter**: "Page X of Y"
- **Disabled States**: Buttons disabled when at first/last page or loading
- **Loading States**: Loading spinner during page transitions

#### Implementation:
- `currentPage` state tracks current page
- `totalProducts` shows total count across all pages
- `hasMoreProducts` boolean for Next button enablement
- `getDistributorProducts()` function handles pagination logic

### 6. **Data Loading Architecture**
```typescript
getAllDistributors() ‚Üí Returns all distributor metadata
getDistributorProducts(id, page, pageSize) ‚Üí Returns paginated products
```

#### Benefits:
- No Firestore dependencies
- Fast loading (300ms simulated delay)
