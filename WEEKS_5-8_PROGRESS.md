## ðŸ’¡ Key Decisions Made

1. **Disbursement API Design**: Single endpoint handles full flow (validate â†’ request â†’ schedule)
2. **Credit Alerts**: Centralized in `credit-operations.ts` for reusability
3. **Repayment Terms**: Calculated at disbursement time (interest + principal)
4. **Automatic Schedule Creation**: Happens immediately on successful disbursement
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback with detailed error messages

- **Week 5-6 (Remaining)**: 4-5 hours
- **Week 7-8**: 6-8 hours
- **Total**: 10-13 hours (spread over 2-3 sessions)
