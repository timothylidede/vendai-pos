# Week 5-6: Credit Disbursement Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented "Pay with Credit" functionality for supplier orders, enabling retailers to place orders using their approved credit facility. This completes 5 of 10 tasks for Weeks 5-8 (50% progress).

## ✅ Completed Components (Tasks 1-5)

### 1. Credit Operations Library (`lib/credit-operations.ts`)
**Lines**: 342  
**Purpose**: Core utility functions for credit management

**Key Functions**:
- `getCreditFacility(retailerId, organizationId)` - Fetches active credit facility from Firestore
- `checkCreditAvailability(retailerId, organizationId, amount)` - Validates if retailer has sufficient credit
- `getCreditAlerts(facility)` - Generates alerts for:
  - High utilization (>85%) - **DANGER**
  - Warning utilization (>70%) - **WARNING**
  - Overdue payments - **DANGER**
  - Expiring facility (<30 days) - **WARNING**
  - Limit increase eligibility (≥12 consecutive on-time payments) - **INFO**
  - Low availability (<20%) - **WARNING**
  - Perfect payment streak - **INFO**

**TypeScript Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface CreditFacility {
  id: string
  facilityId: string
  retailerId: string
  organizationId: string
  approvedAmount: number
  outstandingBalance: number
  availableCredit: number
  creditUtilization: number
  status: 'active' | 'suspended' | 'closed' | 'defaulted' | 'expired'
  interestRate: number
  tenorDays: number
  // ... plus metrics and history
}

interface CreditAvailability {
  hasCredit: boolean
  hasSufficientCredit: boolean
  availableCredit: number
  creditLimit: number
  outstandingBalance: number
  creditUtilization: number
  message: string
  facility: CreditFacility | null
}

interface CreditAlert {
  level: 'info' | 'warning' | 'danger'
  title: string
  message: string
  action?: string
  actionUrl?: string
}
```

---

### 2. Disbursement API Endpoint (`app/api/credit/disburse/route.ts`)
**Lines**: 420  
**Purpose**: Handle credit disbursement requests and status checks

**POST /api/credit/disburse**:
- **Validates**: `retailerId`, `organizationId`, `amount`, `purpose` required
- **Process**:
  1. Checks if retailer has active credit facility
  2. Validates available credit ≥ requested amount
  3. Creates `disbursement` record in Firestore with `pending` status
  4. Calls Pezesha API (`pezeshaClient.requestDisbursement()`)
  5. Updates disbursement record with Pezesha response
  6. If successful, creates repayment schedule with interest calculation
  7. Updates facility's `outstandingBalance`, `totalDisbursed`, and `creditUtilization`
- **Returns**: `{ id, status, pezeshaTransactionId, amount, ... }`

**GET /api/credit/disburse?disbursementId=xxx**:
- **Validates**: Retailer owns the disbursement
- **Returns**: Full disbursement record with status

**Interest Calculation**:
```typescript
interest = amount * (interestRate / 100) * (tenorDays / 365)
totalRepayable = amount + interest
```

**Repayment Schedule Creation**:
- Single installment due at `tenorDays` from disbursement
- Status: `pending`
- Automatically linked to disbursement

---

### 3. Credit Balance Widget (`components/credit/credit-balance-widget.tsx`)
**Lines**: 330  
**Purpose**: Display credit facility status with real-time data and alerts

**Features**:
1. **Facility Status Badge**: Active/Suspended/Closed
2. **Credit Metrics**:
   - Credit Limit (approved amount)
   - Available Credit (green text)
   - Outstanding Balance (red text)
3. **Utilization Progress Bar**:
   - Green: 0-69%
   - Yellow: 70-84%
   - Red: 85-100%
4. **Alert Cards**: Dynamic alerts from `getCreditAlerts()`:
   - Danger (red) - Critical issues
   - Warning (yellow) - Attention needed
   - Info (blue) - Informational notices
5. **Facility Details**:
   - Interest rate (% p.a.)
   - Repayment period (days)
6. **Action Buttons**:
   - "View Details" → `/retailer/credit/details`
   - "Make Payment" → `/retailer/credit/repayments`

**States**:
- **Loading**: Animated skeleton
- **Error**: Shows message with "Apply for Credit" button
- **No Facility**: "Apply for Credit" CTA
- **Active Facility**: Full widget with metrics and alerts

**Auto-refresh**: Fetches latest data on mount and user change

---

### 4. Credit Alerts Utility (Built into credit-operations.ts)
**Purpose**: Generate contextual alerts based on facility state

**Alert Logic**:
- **High Utilization** (>85%): "Your credit is almost fully utilized. Consider making a payment."
- **Warning Utilization** (>70%): "You're using 75% of your credit limit. Manage payments carefully."
- **Overdue Payments**: "You have overdue payments. Pay immediately to avoid penalties." (>0 late repayments)
- **Expiring Soon** (<30 days): "Your credit facility expires in 15 days. Contact us to renew."
- **Limit Increase Eligible**: "Congratulations! You're eligible for a credit limit increase." (≥12 on-time streak)
- **Low Availability** (<20%): "Only KES 10,000 available. Pay down balance to free up credit."
- **Perfect Streak**: "Perfect payment streak! Keep it up for better terms." (≥6 on-time streak, 0 late)

---

### 5. "Pay with Credit" Integration (supplier-module.tsx)
**Modified Lines**: ~150 (in `components/modules/supplier-module.tsx`)

**Checkout Modal Enhancements**:

1. **Payment Method Selector** (NEW):
   ```tsx
   <PaymentMethodButtons>
     [Pay Now] [Use Credit]
   </PaymentMethodButtons>
   ```
   - Wallet icon for immediate payment
   - Credit card icon for credit payment
   - Active selection highlighted in purple

2. **Credit Balance Widget Display** (CONDITIONAL):
   - Shown only when "Use Credit" selected
   - Embedded `<CreditBalanceWidget />` in modal
   - Displays facility status, available credit, alerts

3. **Order Placement Logic** (ENHANCED):
   ```typescript
   if (paymentMethod === "credit") {
     // Step 1: Validate credit availability
     const creditCheck = await checkCreditAvailability(retailerId, orgId, cartTotal)
     if (!creditCheck.hasSufficientCredit) {
       // Show error toast and abort
       return
     }

     // Step 2: Request disbursement
     const disbursement = await POST('/api/credit/disburse', {
       amount: orderTotal,
       purpose: `Payment to ${supplierName}`,
       supplierId, supplierName
     })

     // Step 3: Create PO with disbursement reference
     await POST('/api/supplier/purchase-orders', {
       lines: cartItems,
       paymentMethod: "credit",
       disbursementId: disbursement.id,
       notes: "Order placed using credit"
     })
   } else {
     // Immediate payment - create PO normally
     await POST('/api/supplier/purchase-orders', {
       lines: cartItems,
       paymentMethod: "immediate"
     })
   }
   ```

4. **Success Toast** (UPDATED):
   - Shows: "2 purchase order(s) created totaling KES 45,000 **using credit**"
   - Resets payment method to "immediate" after order

5. **Button Text** (DYNAMIC):
   - "Pay with Credit" when credit selected
   - "Place Order" for immediate payment
   - "Processing..." when disbursement in progress

**Error Handling**:
- Insufficient credit → Toast error with message from API
- Disbursement API failure → Rolls back, no PO created
- Network errors → Clear messaging in toast

## 🔄 Integration Flow

### Supplier Order with Credit (End-to-End)

```
1. Retailer adds products to cart in supplier module
   ↓
2. Clicks "Checkout" → Modal opens
   ↓
3. Selects "Use Credit" payment method
   ↓
4. CreditBalanceWidget loads facility from Firestore
   → Displays: KES 250,000 limit, KES 180,000 available
   → Shows: "High utilization (85%)" warning alert
   ↓
5. Retailer clicks "Pay with Credit"
   ↓
6. handlePlaceOrder() executes:
   a. Calls checkCreditAvailability(retailerId, orgId, cartTotal=45000)
      → Returns: { hasSufficientCredit: true, availableCredit: 180000 }
   b. Calls POST /api/credit/disburse
      → Validates facility exists
      → Checks availableCredit ≥ 45000 ✅
      → Creates disbursement record in Firestore (status: pending)
      → Calls pezeshaClient.requestDisbursement(45000, supplier details)
      → Pezesha responds: { transactionId: 'TXN123', status: 'completed' }
      → Updates disbursement record (status: completed)
      → Creates repayment schedule:
         * amount: 45000
         * interest: 45000 * (12/100) * (90/365) = 1,330.68
         * totalAmount: 46,330.68
         * dueDate: 90 days from now
         * status: pending
      → Updates facility:
         * outstandingBalance: 70000 + 45000 = 115000
         * totalDisbursed: 200000 + 45000 = 245000
         * availableCredit: 250000 - 115000 = 135000
         * creditUtilization: 115000 / 250000 = 0.46 (46%)
   c. Calls POST /api/supplier/purchase-orders
      → Creates PO with:
         * lines: cart items
         * paymentMethod: "credit"
         * disbursementId: "disb_xxx"
         * notes: "Order placed using credit by John Doe"
   ↓
7. Toast notification: "1 purchase order created totaling KES 45,000 using credit"

## 📝 Testing Checklist (Before Going Live)

### Unit Tests
- [ ] `getCreditFacility()` returns null if no active facility
- [ ] `checkCreditAvailability()` rejects amounts > availableCredit
- [ ] `getCreditAlerts()` generates correct alerts for each scenario
- [ ] Disbursement API validates all required fields
- [ ] Interest calculation is accurate (manual verification)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end order with credit (cart → disbursement → PO creation)
- [ ] Insufficient credit error handling (shows toast, doesn't create PO)
- [ ] Credit widget displays correct data from Firestore
- [ ] Payment method toggle works (immediate ↔ credit)
- [ ] Multiple orders in same session (credit balance updates correctly)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No active facility (shows "Apply for Credit")
- [ ] Suspended facility (shows error)
- [ ] Expired facility (shows error)
- [ ] Cart total exceeds available credit (blocks order)
- [ ] Network failure during disbursement (graceful error)
- [ ] Pezesha API timeout (retry logic)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Widget loads in <500ms
- [ ] Disbursement API responds in <2s (excluding Pezesha delay)
- [ ] 100 concurrent orders don't deadlock Firestore
- [ ] Alert generation doesn't block UI render

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

### Known Issues (Minor)
1. **Organization ID Placeholder**: Currently using `uid` as `organizationId`. Need to implement proper org structure when multi-user orgs launch.
2. **Timezone Handling**: All dates in Firestore are UTC. Need to convert to East Africa Time (EAT) for display.
3. **Repayment Schedule**: Only creates 1 installment per disbursement. Future: Support multiple installments for longer tenors.

### Future Enhancements
1. **Partial Payments**: Allow retailers to pay portion of due amount
2. **Early Repayment Discount**: Incentivize paying before due date
3. **Credit Utilization Alerts**: Push notification when >80% utilized
4. **Dynamic Interest Rates**: Lower rates for high credit scores
5. **Multi-Currency**: Support USD/EUR for international suppliers

### Dependencies
- **Pezesha API**: Production credentials needed before launch
- **M-Pesa API**: Safaricom integration for STK push (Week 7)
- **Firebase Indexes**: Ensure composite indexes exist for credit queries
- **SMS Gateway**: AfricasTalking or Twilio for payment reminders (Week 8)
