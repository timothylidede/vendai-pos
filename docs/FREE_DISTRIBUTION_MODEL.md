# VendAI POS — Free Distribution Model

_Last updated: October 11, 2025_

## Overview

VendAI POS is distributed for **free to retailers** via manual flash drive installation. The platform monetizes through a **5% commission on distributor orders**, reconciled bi-weekly. This model prioritizes **offline-first operation** to minimize friction in low-connectivity environments.

## Business Model

### Revenue Strategy
- **Free to retailers**: No subscription fees, no upfront costs
- **Commission-based**: 5% of distributor order GMV
- **Payment flow**: Retailer → Distributor (direct) → Platform (reconciled bi-weekly)
- **Similar to**: Uber/Bolt driver commission model

### Value Proposition
- **For Retailers**: Free POS system with inventory management, offline support
- **For Distributors**: Access to retailer network, streamlined ordering
- **For Platform**: Scalable revenue tied to transaction volume

```

#### Installation Process
1. **Field agent** visits retailer with USB drive
2. **Plug & Play**: Installer launches automatically (or manual run)
3. **Offline Setup Wizard**:
   - Organization details (name, location, contact)
   - Initial product catalog (import or start blank)
   - Hardware setup (barcode scanner, receipt printer)
   - Admin user creation
4. **Local Database Init**: SQLite database created with org data
5. **First Sync**: When internet available, sync with cloud Firestore
6. **Training**: Field agent demonstrates core features

#### Auto-Updater
- **Check for updates** when internet connection detected
- **Background download** of new versions
- **Install on next restart** with user notification
- **Rollback capability** if update fails
- **Release notes** displayed before update

## Offline-First Architecture

### Core Principles
1. **Work offline by default** — All features functional without internet
2. **Sync when available** — Background sync on connection restore
3. **Conflict resolution** — Handle concurrent edits gracefully
4. **Data locality** — Cache everything needed for daily operations

### Technical Stack

#### Local Storage (Offline)
- **SQLite Database** (Electron main process)
  - Products, inventory, suppliers, orders
  - Fast queries for POS transactions
  - Transaction history with full line items
- **IndexedDB** (Web fallback)
  - Same schema as SQLite for web deployments
  - Service worker for offline caching

#### Cloud Sync (Online)
- **Firestore** (source of truth)
  - Syncs with local database when connected
  - Handles multi-device scenarios
  - Provides real-time updates
- **Firebase Storage**
  - Product images, receipts, invoices
  - Lazy load with local caching

### Data Sync Strategy

#### Sync Queue
```typescript
interface SyncQueueItem {
  id: string
  type: 'order' | 'inventory' | 'product' | 'payment'
  action: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete'
  data: any
  timestamp: number
  retries: number
  status: 'pending' | 'syncing' | 'synced' | 'failed'
  error?: string
}
```

#### Sync Process
1. **Detect Connection**: Network status listener
2. **Process Queue**: FIFO order with retry logic
3. **Conflict Detection**: Compare timestamps, last-write-wins
4. **Error Handling**: Exponential backoff, manual retry option
5. **Progress Indicator**: Show sync status in UI

#### Conflict Resolution
- **Inventory adjustments**: Sum changes, never overwrite
- **Orders**: Cloud version wins (immutable after creation)
- **Products**: Last-write-wins with conflict log
- **Pricing**: Cloud version wins (distributor controls pricing)

### Offline Features

#### POS Transactions
- ✅ Scan barcodes and add to cart (local product lookup)
- ✅ Calculate totals and taxes
- ✅ Accept cash payments (no card/M-Pesa offline)
- ✅ Print receipts (thermal printer via USB)
- ✅ Queue transaction for sync (stored locally)

#### Inventory Management
- ✅ View current stock levels (local database)
- ✅ Record stock adjustments (sync later)
- ✅ Low-stock alerts (calculated locally)
- ✅ Receive deliveries (mark PO as received, sync later)

#### Supplier Orders
- ✅ Browse cached supplier catalogs
- ✅ Create purchase orders (saved locally)
- ✅ Submit when online (synced to distributor)

#### Reports
- ✅ Sales reports (local data)
- ✅ Inventory reports (local data)
- ✅ Transaction history (local data)
- ⚠️ Cross-org analytics (requires online)
