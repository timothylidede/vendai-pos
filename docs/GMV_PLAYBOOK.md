# VendAI GMV Growth Playbook

Commission-first model: Grow GMV with three levers and enabling layers (credit, coverage, retention).

GMV = Retailers × Average Order Value (AOV) × Order Frequency

## Phases

1) 0 → 100 retailers (Validation)
- Hook: Free POS + Inventory
- Frictionless onboarding (Google OAuth, pricelist ingest, auto catalog)
- Seed 3–5 must-have distributors per area
- KPI: 40% of POS users place at least 1 supplier order/month

2) 100 → 1,000 retailers (Coverage)
- Expand distributor categories: staples, beverages, hygiene, impulse
- Restock suggestions + one-tap reorder
- Referral program (retailer→retailer)
- KPI: +25% AOV via bundles, +50% order frequency via alerts/subscriptions

3) 1,000 → 10,000 retailers (Scale)
- Regional distributor onboarding pipeline (SLAs, pricing freshness)
- BNPL pilot with risk partner; target +20–40% AOV lift
- Intelligent routing to best-priced distributors
- KPI: 2 orders/retailer/month, $300 AOV

## Levers

- Retailers
  - Referrals, partner channels, field teams with instant setup
- AOV
  - Bundles, cross-sell, AI restock basket, bulk discounts
- Frequency
  - Low-stock alerts, subscriptions, faster delivery cycles

## Enablers

- Distributor Network: breadth of SKUs, reliability, fresh pricing
- BNPL/Credit: unlock constrained buyers; partner-based risk
- Retention: reorder UX, loyalty tiers, personalized offers

## Targets (example)

- 10,000 retailers × $300 × 2 orders/mo = $6M GMV/mo (~$72M/yr)
- 5% commission = $3.6M ARR
