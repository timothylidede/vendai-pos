## üö™ How to Get the Meeting

### Option 1: Cold Email (Recommended)
**To**: partnerships@pezesha.com, sales@pezesha.com  
**Subject**: VendAI POS - Distribution Partnership for 1,000+ Kenyan Retailers

```
Dear Pezesha Team,

I'm Timothy Lidede, founder of VendAI, a POS system serving Kenyan retailers. 
We've built a platform with 1,000+ registered retailers and are integrating 
embedded credit to help them finance inventory purchases.

We've completed the technical build (credit application, scoring engine, 
disbursement API integration) and are ready to connect with Pezesha's lending 
infrastructure. We believe this partnership could:

‚úÖ Give Pezesha access to 1,000+ verified retailers
‚úÖ Provide real POS data for accurate credit scoring
‚úÖ Drive KES 30M+ in disbursements within 6 months

I'd love 30 minutes to show you our platform and discuss a partnership.
Are you available this week?

Best regards,
Timothy Lidede
Founder, VendAI
+254 [Your Phone]
timothy@vendai.app
```

### Option 2: LinkedIn Connection
**Steps**:
1. Find Pezesha employees on LinkedIn (Head of Partnerships, CCO)
2. Send connection request with note:
   ```
   Hi [Name], I'm building VendAI, a POS for Kenyan retailers. 
   We're integrating embedded credit and would love to explore 
   partnering with Pezesha. Would you be open to a quick chat?
   ```
3. Follow up with meeting request

### Option 3: Walk-In (If Near Their Office)

**Approach**:
```
"Hi, I'm Timothy from VendAI. We've built a POS system with over 1,000 
Kenyan retailers and are looking to integrate lending through Pezesha. 
Is there someone from partnerships I could speak with briefly? 
I can show a quick demo."
```

**Bring**:
- Laptop with demo ready
- One-page flyer (see below)
- Business cards

## üé§ The Pitch (7-Minute Version)

### Opening (60 seconds)
```
"Hi [Name], I'm Timothy, founder of VendAI. We're a POS system built 
specifically for Kenyan retailers - think small shops, kiosks, and 
mini-supermarkets.

We've been live for [X months] and have [X] retailers using our platform 
daily. They process an average of [X] transactions per day, generating 
real-time sales data.

The challenge? 80% of our retailers struggle to afford inventory because 
they don't have access to credit. Banks won't lend to them because they 
lack collateral and formal credit history.

We built a solution: embedded credit directly in the POS. Retailers can 
apply for credit, get approved in 24-48 hours, and pay suppliers instantly 
- all without leaving our app.

The technical build is done. We just need a lending partner with the 
regulatory license and capital. That's why we're here."
```

### The Problem (90 seconds)
```
"Let me paint a picture of our typical retailer:

Meet Jane. She runs a small shop in Eastlands. She buys inventory from 
wholesalers every week - milk, bread, sugar, cooking oil.

Her problem:
‚ùå Wholesalers demand cash upfront
‚ùå Banks say 'no collateral, no loan'
‚ùå Mobile lenders charge 20-30% interest for 30-day loans
‚ùå She can't grow because she's always cash-strapped

Traditional solutions don't work:
‚ùå Bank loans: Too slow (weeks), need collateral, high interest
‚ùå Saccos: Limited capital, manual processes
‚ùå Mobile lenders: Predatory rates, short terms

The gap: Jane needs KES 50K-100K for 30-60 days at 12-15% APR to buy 
inventory. No one serves this market efficiently."
```

### The Solution (90 seconds)
```
"VendAI solves this with embedded credit:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Jane applies for credit directly in our POS app (5-min form)
2Ô∏è‚É£ We use her real sales data to calculate a credit score (no guesswork)
3Ô∏è‚É£ She gets approved for KES 100K in 24 hours
4Ô∏è‚É£ When she places a supplier order, she clicks 'Pay with Credit'
5Ô∏è‚É£ We disburse funds directly to the supplier
6Ô∏è‚É£ Jane repays over 3-6 months via M-Pesa auto-debit

The magic: We have the data (POS transactions). You have the license 
and capital. Together we can serve this massive underserved market.

[Show 2-minute demo on laptop if possible]
```

### Why VendAI is Different (60 seconds)
```
"Here's why this works:

‚úÖ Real Data: We track daily sales, not just applications
‚úÖ Built-In: Credit is native to the POS, not a separate app
‚úÖ Verified Retailers: All our users are real businesses
‚úÖ Low CAC: We acquire retailers for POS, credit is upsell
‚úÖ Sticky: Credit keeps them on our platform

Our retailers average:
‚Ä¢ KES 50K-200K in monthly sales
‚Ä¢ 20-40 transactions per day
‚Ä¢ 6-18 months on platform
‚Ä¢ 70% use M-Pesa already (easy repayment)

This isn't theoretical. We have 1,000 retailers ready to apply."
```

### The Ask (60 seconds)
```
"Here's what we need from Pezesha:

1Ô∏è‚É£ API Access:
   - Sandbox for testing (this week)
   - Production keys after pilot (30 days)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Partnership Structure:
   - VendAI: Credit application + scoring + retailer relationship
   - Pezesha: KYC/CRB check + capital + regulatory compliance
   - Revenue share: 60/40 or 70/30 split on interest (negotiable)
   - OR: Fixed commission per disbursement (3-5%)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Pilot Program:
   - 10 retailers
   - KES 50K-100K credit each
   - 30-60 day terms
   - 30 days to validate model

4Ô∏è‚É£ Timeline:
   - Week 1: API integration complete
   - Week 2: Pilot launch
   - Week 6: Review results
   - Month 3: Scale to 100 retailers

What questions do you have?"
```

### Closing (60 seconds)
```
"I know you get partnership pitches every week. Here's why VendAI is different:

1. We're not asking for investment. We have a product in market.
2. We're not asking you to change anything. Your APIs work as-is.
3. We bring you customers + data. You provide capital + compliance.
4. This is a true partnership, not a vendor relationship.

The Kenyan retail credit market is KES 50B+. Banks serve <5% of it. 
Digital lenders serve another 10%. That leaves 85% untapped.

We can capture 1% of that market together - that's KES 500M in loans, 
KES 25M in revenue to split.

Can we start with sandbox access this week and a pilot next month?"
```

## üíº What VendAI Brings to the Table

### 1. Distribution Channel

- **Growing at 50-100 new retailers/month**
- **Geographic spread**: Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru
- **Sectors**: General retail, pharmacies, hardware, agro-vets

### 2. Data Goldmine
- **Real-time POS data** (not self-reported)
- **Transaction-level granularity** (SKU, quantity, price, time)
- **Multi-dimensional signals** (sales velocity, consistency, growth)
- **Verified businesses** (active for 30+ days)

### 3. Credit Infrastructure (Already Built)
- ‚úÖ Credit application UI (5-step form)
- ‚úÖ Document upload system (KRA PIN, business cert, ID)
- ‚úÖ Credit scoring engine (6-component algorithm)
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard (approve/reject applications)
- ‚úÖ Disbursement flow ("Pay with Credit")
- ‚úÖ Repayment schedule UI
- ‚úÖ M-Pesa auto-debit integration

- ‚úÖ Webhook handlers (for Pezesha callbacks)

**Translation**: We're not asking Pezesha to build anything. Just plug into our system.

### 4. Risk Mitigation
- **Pre-screened retailers** (30+ days transaction history required)
- **Conservative starting limits** (KES 50K-100K, not KES 1M)
- **Short terms** (3-6 months, not 12+ months)
- **Auto-debit repayment** (M-Pesa STK push, not manual collection)
- **Real-time monitoring** (we see if sales drop before you do)

### 5. Low Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- **VendAI handles marketing**: Retailers come for POS, discover credit
- **In-app acquisition**: No separate app download needed
- **Warm leads**: Retailers already trust VendAI brand
- **Estimated CAC**: KES 5,000 (vs KES 15,000+ for direct lending)

## üìà Revenue Projections (6-12 Months)

### Conservative Scenario
```
100 retailers √ó KES 100K average credit √ó 4 disbursements/year = KES 40M
Interest: 12% APR = KES 4.8M
Commission @ 3%: KES 1.2M to VendAI

Pezesha Revenue: KES 3.6M (interest - commission)
VendAI Revenue: KES 1.2M
```

### Moderate Scenario
```
300 retailers √ó KES 150K average √ó 6 disbursements/year = KES 270M
Interest: 12% APR = KES 32.4M
Commission @ 4%: KES 10.8M to VendAI

Pezesha Revenue: KES 21.6M
VendAI Revenue: KES 10.8M
```

### Aggressive Scenario
```
500 retailers √ó KES 200K average √ó 8 disbursements/year = KES 800M
Interest: 12% APR = KES 96M
Commission @ 5%: KES 40M to VendAI

Pezesha Revenue: KES 56M
VendAI Revenue: KES 40M
```

**Key Assumptions**:
- 12% APR interest rate (competitive with market)
- 3-5% commission to VendAI
- 3-8 credit cycles per retailer per year
- 3-5% default rate (industry standard)
- 30-60 day repayment terms

## üéØ Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "We already have distribution partners"
**Response**:
```
"That's great - it validates the model. But I imagine your current partners 
are either:
A) Financial institutions (banks, Saccos) with existing customer bases, OR
B) Digital platforms (e-commerce, logistics) with transaction data

VendAI is unique because we're a POS system - we have BOTH:
‚úÖ Daily transaction data (not just application data)
‚úÖ Direct access to retailers (they use our software every day)

We're also not competing with your existing partners. We serve a different 
segment: small retail shops (KES 50K-200K sales/month) that banks ignore.

Can I show you our data vs typical loan applications?"
```

### Objection 2: "Your retailers are too small / risky"
**Response**:
```
"I understand the concern. Let me address it with data:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Small = Lower Default Risk:
   - KES 50K loan on a shop doing KES 100K/month sales = 50% utilization
   - Compare to: KES 500K loan on weak data = 10x the risk
   - Our retailers can afford to repay because loans are sized correctly

2Ô∏è‚É£ Real Data = Better Decisions:
   - We don't rely on self-reported income
   - We see actual sales daily for 90+ days
   - If sales drop, we know before the retailer applies

3Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-Debit = Higher Recovery:
   - M-Pesa STK push on due date (no manual collection)
   - 90%+ of our retailers already use M-Pesa
   - Reduces default risk significantly

Let's start with 10 retailers with PERFECT credit scores (80+) and prove 
the model. If they default, I'll personally guarantee the first KES 500K."
```

### Objection 3: "This will take too long to integrate"
**Response**:
```
"Actually, we've already done 90% of the work:

‚úÖ Credit application UI: Built
‚úÖ Document upload: Built
‚úÖ Credit scoring: Built
‚úÖ Disbursement flow: Built
‚úÖ Repayment tracking: Built
‚úÖ Webhook handlers: Built

All we need from you:
1. API credentials (5 minutes)
2. Webhook URL (1 configuration)
3. Test disbursement (1 hour)

Total integration time: 1 week (not 3 months)

[Show demo on laptop - prove it's built]

We can have the first test disbursement done this week if you give us 
sandbox access today."
```

### Objection 4: "What if retailers default?"
**Response**:
```
"Great question. Here's our risk mitigation strategy:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Screening:
   - 90+ days of transaction history required
   - Minimum sales threshold (KES 50K/month)
   - Credit score >55 for approval

2Ô∏è‚É£ Conservative Limits:
   - Start with KES 50K (not KES 500K)
   - Max 50% of monthly sales as credit limit
   - Grow limits based on repayment performance

3Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-Repayment:
   - M-Pesa STK push on due date
   - No manual collection needed
   - Reminders at 7, 3, 1 days before due

4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Monitoring:
   - We see if sales drop (early warning)
   - Freeze new credit if payment late >7 days
   - Alert you if red flags appear

5Ô∏è‚É£ Pilot Structure:
   - Start with 10 retailers (low exposure)
   - Validate <5% default rate
   - Scale only if model works

Plus: I'm willing to personally guarantee the first KES 500K in the pilot. 
That's how confident I am in our data."
```

### Objection 5: "We need to discuss this internally"
**Response**:
```
"Absolutely, I respect that. Let me make it easy for you:

What specific questions do your team need answered?
- Technical integration details?
- Risk model validation?
- Legal/compliance requirements?
- Pilot structure and metrics?

I can prepare materials on any of these topics and send them over today.

Also, would it help if I presented directly to your credit committee or 
exec team? I'm happy to come back for a 20-minute deeper dive.

Timeline-wise, we're ready to move fast. Our developers are on standby 
for integration. If you can give us sandbox access this week, we can 
have a working integration in 7 days.

What's your typical timeline for partnership decisions? Can we aim for 
a pilot launch by [date 3-4 weeks out]?"
```

## üéì Final Tips

### Before the Meeting
- ‚úÖ **Practice your pitch** 5 times (aim for 7 minutes exactly)
- ‚úÖ **Test demo on laptop** (ensure internet works)
- ‚úÖ **Research Pezesha's recent news** (funding rounds, partnerships)
- ‚úÖ **Stalk LinkedIn profiles** of people you're meeting
- ‚úÖ **Dress professionally** (business casual minimum)
- ‚úÖ **Arrive 10 minutes early** (never late)

### During the Meeting
- ‚úÖ **Lead with confidence** (you have a working product)
- ‚úÖ **Listen more than talk** (60/40 rule)
- ‚úÖ **Take notes** (shows you're serious)
- ‚úÖ **Ask for the sale** ("Can we start with sandbox access this week?")
- ‚úÖ **Be flexible on terms** (don't blow deal over 1% commission)
- ‚úÖ **Show enthusiasm** (but not desperation)

### After the Meeting
- ‚úÖ **Send follow-up email within 2 hours**
- ‚úÖ **Connect on LinkedIn** (with personalized note)
- ‚úÖ **Follow up in 3 days** if no response
- ‚úÖ **Be patient but persistent** (partnerships take time)

### Red Flags to Watch For
- ‚ùå They want you to pay for API access (should be free)
- ‚ùå They want exclusivity before proving model (negotiate)
- ‚ùå They can't commit to any timeline (may not be serious)
- ‚ùå They don't understand your value prop (wrong audience)

## üöÄ Confidence Boosters

### Remember:
