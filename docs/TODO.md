## Engineering Notes

### Priority Scoring
- **P0 (Blocker)**: Required for production launch
- **P1 (High)**: Core value prop, needed within 1-2 sprints
- **P2 (Medium)**: Improves UX/ops efficiency
- **P3 (Nice-to-have)**: Future enhancement, defer if resource-constrained

### Suggested Phase Priorities
- **Phase 1** (MVP+): P0/P1 ‚Äî Focus on receiving flow, multi-lane POS, offline mode
- **Phase 2** (Usability): P1/P2 ‚Äî Onboarding wizard, bulk mapping, restock recommendations
- **Phase 3** (Security): P0 ‚Äî RBAC, audit logs (required for multi-tenant SaaS)
- **Phase 4** (AI): P2/P3 ‚Äî Image cleanup, anomaly detection (value-add features)
- **Phase 5** (Integrations): P1/P2 ‚Äî M-Pesa (critical for Kenya), POS connectors (expands TAM)

### Testing Checklist Template
For each feature:
- [ ] Unit tests for core logic (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] Integration tests for API routes (supertest)
- [ ] Firestore transaction tests (emulator)
- [ ] E2E tests for critical flows (Playwright)
- [ ] Manual QA on Windows + Electron shell
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent POS transactions

---

## Questions / Decisions Needed

- **Offline mode**: Use IndexedDB or LocalStorage? How long to retain queued transactions?
- **RBAC**: Firebase Auth custom claims or Firestore-based permissions?
- **Image pipeline**: Continue with Replicate or switch to OpenAI DALL-E?
- **Webhooks**: Retry policy ‚Äî max 3 attempts or exponential backoff up to 24 hours?
- **Barcode scales**: Support only EAN-13 price-embedded or also custom formats?
