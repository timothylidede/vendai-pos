# VendAI POS - Development TODO

_Last updated: 4 Oct 2025_

## üîß Recent Fixes (4 Oct 2025)

### Fixed Issues in Supplier & Inventory Modules
- ‚úÖ **Supplier Module** (`components/modules/supplier-module.tsx`)
  - Fixed Image component errors (removed `fill` prop, added explicit width/height)
  - Fixed variable declaration order (moved useMemo hooks before callbacks that depend on them)
  - Fixed RetailerData status type to properly enforce union type
  - Fixed SettlementRecord status and dueDate type mismatches
  - Added missing InvoicePayment.id field
  - Added missing `loading` state variable

- ‚úÖ **Inventory Module** (`components/modules/inventory-module.tsx`)
  - Fixed `limitQuery` error by replacing with correct `limit` function from firebase/firestore

### Verification Status
- ‚úÖ **Logistics Module** - Verified to use real Firestore data (sales_orders, drivers, routes)
- ‚úÖ **Retailers Module** - Verified to use real Firestore data (users where role = retailer)
- ‚úÖ **Credit API** - `/api/credit/assess`, `/api/credit/history`, and `/api/credit/limits` implemented
- ‚úÖ **Invoice PATCH** - `/api/invoices/[id]` supports status and payment updates



## ‚úÖ Already Done_Last updated: 4 Oct 2025_## A. Core API Endpoints
