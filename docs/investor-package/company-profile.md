## 1. Overview

VendAI is building the digital operating system for East Africa’s neighbourhood grocers, mini-marts, and mid-market supermarkets. We deliver an offline-first, AI-assisted point-of-sale and inventory platform that connects retailers directly with FMCG distributors and embedded credit providers. Our model is designed to digitise the 200,000+ formal and semi-formal retailers across Kenya, improve distributor visibility, and unlock access to working capital.

- **Founded:** 2025 (Nairobi, Kenya)
- **Stage:** Pre-seed (seeking USD 100,000)
- **Product:** Offline-first POS + inventory management + supplier marketplace + embedded credit
- **Business Model:** Free core POS; 5% commission on supplier-retailer transactions; value-added subscriptions (analytics, multi-store) from 2026

## 2. Problem

Retailers operate with paper-based workflows, limited inventory visibility, and fragmented supplier relationships. Existing B2B marketplaces attempted to replace distributors, leading to high CAC and low retention. Retailers prefer to keep their sourcing relationships via WhatsApp and phone, creating blind spots for distributors and credit providers.

## 3. Solution

VendAI equips retailers with a free offline-first POS that automatically syncs inventory, builds AI-powered product catalogues from distributor pricelists, and feeds real-time sales telemetry back to partner distributors and credit platforms. We enable the existing distribution chain rather than disintermediating it.

**Key Features**
- Offline-first POS with automatic sync to the cloud and multi-lane support
- AI ingestion of distributor pricelists (CSV, PDF, WhatsApp images) to build catalogues in minutes
- Embedded credit scoring using sales, inventory, and repayment telemetry
- Supplier portal with automated order queueing and fulfilment visibility
- Conflict resolution and offline queueing to guarantee no data loss

## 4. Market

- **Total Addressable Market (Kenya):** ~200,000 retailers; annual FMCG throughput c. USD 8bn
- **Serviceable Available Market (focus on mini-marts & supermarkets):** ~38,000 outlets
- **Comparable Spend:** Retailers currently pay KES 10,000 – 25,000 per year for legacy POS licenses and receive zero supply-chain integration.

## 5. Traction & Milestones

- 180 retailers in Nairobi signed LOIs; 72 active pilots (as of September 2025)
- Distributor pilots live with **Sam West**, **Mahitaji**, and two regional wholesalers (Kiambu & Machakos)
- Strategic partnerships signed with **Pezesha** and **Wareflow** to embed stock-financing and invoice factoring
- Selected for the **INSEAD AI Founder Sprint 2025**; Demo Day scheduled December 2025
- Offline-first queueing architecture tested across 6 counties with 99.96% sync success
- Pipeline of 18 mini-mart chains (5–25 branches each) onboarding in Q4 2025

## 6. Team

- **Tim Lidede (Founder & CEO):** Product & growth leader; previously scaled retail automation projects at Wareflow
- **Davis Kipchirchir (Founder & CTO) –** 3 years building offline-first mobile systems; ex-Safaricom architecture team
- **Head of Distribution Partnerships –** former regional sales manager at Proctor & Allan with 12 years FMCG experience
- Supported by advisors from Pezesha (credit risk), Wareflow (logistics), and alumni mentors from INSEAD AI Sprint

## 7. Competitive Edge

- **Legacy POS vendors:** Depend on upfront licenses and provide no supply-chain integration, forcing retailers to pay high fees for limited insight. VendAI keeps the product free, earns from transactions, and gives modern analytics the incumbents lack.
- **B2B marketplaces (Wasoko, MarketForce):** Tried to own distribution fleets, creating channel conflict and heavy logistics costs. VendAI enables existing distributors instead, carrying no inventory and keeping their relationships intact.
- **DIY tools (Excel, WhatsApp):** Manual processes create errors and leave credit providers blind. VendAI automates sync, tracks telemetry, and delivers supplier dashboards so every stakeholder sees the same real-time data.

## 8. Business Model & Economics

- **Revenue Streams:** 5% commission on confirmed supplier orders; add-on subscriptions for analytics, multi-store, and integrations; data services for credit bureaus (post-2026)
- **Unit Economics (2026 forecast):**
  - Average active retailer monthly GMV: USD 1,050
  - Take rate: 5% (USD 52.50 per retailer per month)
  - Gross margin: 92%
  - CAC payback: <6 months (WhatsApp groups + distributor referrals)

## 9. Roadmap

- **Q4 2025:** 1,000 active retailers; USD 10k MRR; launch distributor dashboards; expand to Eldoret & Kisumu
- **2026:** Multi-branch subscription module, automated eTIMS integration, roll-out with two national distributor groups
- **2027:** Pan-East Africa expansion beginning with Tanzania and Uganda; launch data products for lenders

## 10. Funding

- **Current round:** USD 100,000 pre-seed SAFE
- **Use of proceeds:** 40% product & engineering, 30% go-to-market, 15% credit/compliance, 10% operations, 5% working capital buffer (see detailed breakdown in `use-of-funds.md`)
- **Prior funding:** Founder capital USD 35,000; grants USD 10,000 (AI Founder Sprint)
