# Retailer Onboarding Tri‑Fold Brochure — Layout, Print, and Copy

This matches your attached template (two landscape pages). Use it in Canva/Figma/InDesign or hand to a print shop.

---

## How this tri‑fold prints and folds
- Size: US Letter (8.5" × 11"), landscape, 2 pages (front/outside and back/inside)
- Fold: Letter/“roll” fold: left panel folds in first, then right panel folds over it (right panel becomes the front cover)
- Duplex printing: Enable two‑sided/duplex and set Flip on Short Edge (so the top of both sides aligns)
- Bleed: 0.125" (3 mm) on all edges; Safe margin: 0.25" (6 mm)
- Fold‑in panel width: If you can edit panel widths, make the inside flap (outside left panel) ~0.0625" narrower to prevent buckling

### Panel map for your exact template
When looking at each full page as a single landscape spread:

Page 1 = Outside (cover side), left → right
1) OUTSIDE LEFT = Inside flap (folds in first)
2) OUTSIDE MIDDLE = Back cover
3) OUTSIDE RIGHT = Front cover (this will be on the outside when folded)

Page 2 = Inside (opens to this), left → right
4) INSIDE LEFT
5) INSIDE MIDDLE
6) INSIDE RIGHT

Folding order: Left panel (inside flap) folds in first → Right panel folds over it → You see the Front cover.
